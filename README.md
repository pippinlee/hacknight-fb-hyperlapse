## Hacknight project

* Goal: duplicate FB's Hyperlapse intro screen on the web
* Why: layering of audio tracks allows the user to add to the song, in a progressive nature, till the last slide, where the song is complete and all instruments/tracks play together
* Can't be done on mobile, because mobile browsers don't autoplay video
* Made 4 layers of music
* Video from [Evgeniy](http://vimeo.com/83210136)
* Didn't have iMovie installed, so used ffmpeg for all slice and cutting of video and it's audio
* ffmpeg is magic
